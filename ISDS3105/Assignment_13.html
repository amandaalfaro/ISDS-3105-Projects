         <p>The class will focus on search engine optimization and the tools and methodologies to achieve and optimized websites: understanding web crawlers, website ranking algorithms, difference in search engines, search engine marketing and ethics in SEO. Emphasis will be placed on current practices and technologies used by SEO professionals in today’s businesses.</p>
         <h2><a href="Material/3105syllabus_fall2009.htm">Syllabus</a></h2>
         
         <p>The course will be delivered through Moodle. The students will be required to watch lectures through Moodle, attend meetings with the instructor, complete assignments, quizzes and exams and complete several projects. </p>
         <ol>
    <li><a name="Assignment" id="Assignment"></a>Assignments:	There will be two assignments each week to provide practice and better understanding of the concepts discussed in class.  All assignments are due at the time schedules on Moodle.  Assignments submitted after the due date will not be counted for your grade. </li>
    <li><a name="Grading" id="Grading"></a>Grading:	A 10 point grading scale will be used for the course.  Note that “A” assignments are SEO assignments while “B” assignments are Dream Weaver assignments. The final grade will be calculated as follows: 	Quizzes   25% 	Assignments  50%	 	Midterm  10%			 	Final Exam  15%	 			 Groups will be assigned by instructor for discussion and meeting purposes.  All assignments will be graded on an individual basis.   Make-up tests will not be allowed without prior permission.  If you should miss a test, a university-approved excuse is required and must be submitted to me within one week of your absence.   You have one week to discuss and correct any problems with a graded assignment or exam.  After the one week grace period is over, the grade stands! Final grades will not be rounded or ‘curved’ so please be aware of this.  This means it takes a 90 or above to earn an A, an 80 or above to earn a B, etc. </li>
    <li><a name="CourseStructure" id="CourseStructure"></a>Course Structure: The course will be structured in a way that allows you to learn both, the key issues in SEO and some basic understanding of Dream Weaver. But remember that this is not a course in Dreamweaver. Tuesdays’ lectures and assignments will concentrate on SEO topics and Thursdays’ topics will deal with Dream Weaver.    I will not use a textbook. All information we will be using in this course can be found on the web or posted on Moodle.  The midterm and final exam will consist of multiple choice questions from Quizzes.   The schedule below is tentative and may change slightly due to unforeseen events. </li>
